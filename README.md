# Stage 4 (Full Pipeline 2: Reproducing Science)

## Overview:
---
In this task, you will reproduce the development of an interactive R Shiny app for performing functional enrichment analysis as described in the paper [ShinyGO: a graphical gene-set enrichment tool for animals and plants](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/8/2628/5688742?login=false). Specifically, you will create a Shiny app that leverages the TCGAanalyze_EAcomplete() and TCGA_EAbarplot() function from the TCGAbiolinks package in R (Engage with a Biomarker developer to explain this to you). Overall, please keep things simple for now.

1. Form a team of 3
2. Read the paper
3. Understand the principles of functional enrichment.
4. Understand the following outputs of functional enrichment
      Gene Ontology
      Biological Process
      Cellular components
      Molecular Functions
      Pathways
5. Learn to use and implement the two core functions for our analysis
6. Install TCGABiolinks
7. Implement TCGAanalyze_EAcomplete() and TCGA_EAbarplot() on any set of gene lists
Develop a simple yet clean clone of ShinygGO using the 2 functions you implemented in step 2b
Render the images with TCGA_EAbarplot()
Host the R Shiny app on a server (e.g., shinyapps.io) and provide the URL for access.
8. Documentation and reporting
9. Provide clear documentation within the app on how to use it.
10. Write a concise report explaining the app's functionality, the methods used for the analysis, and any challenges encountered during development.
